### Deploying Contracts

The deployment script can automatically deploy the Hats Protocol and Hats Module Factory contracts if they're not already set in your environment:

```bash
# Deploy all contracts including Hats Protocol and Hats Module Factory if needed
forge script script/DeployHatsAVS.s.sol:DeployHatsAVS --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
```

If you already have deployed instances of the Hats Protocol and Hats Module Factory, set their addresses in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Optional: Set these if you have existing deployments
HATS_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS=0x... # Address of the deployed Hats Protocol contract
HATS_MODULE_FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x... # Address of the deployed Hats Module Factory
```

After deployment, the script will add the deployed contract addresses to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Hats Protocol AVS Integration Addresses
HATS_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS=0x...
HATS_MODULE_FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x...
HATS_ELIGIBILITY_SERVICE_HANDLER_IMPL=0x...
HATS_TOGGLE_SERVICE_HANDLER_IMPL=0x...
HATS_AVS_HATTER_IMPL=0x...
HATS_ELIGIBILITY_SERVICE_HANDLER=0x...
HATS_TOGGLE_SERVICE_HANDLER=0x...
HATS_AVS_HATTER=0x...
HATS_AVS_MANAGER=0x...
```

These changes will:

1. Automatically deploy Hats Protocol and Hats Module Factory contracts if they're not already set in your environment
2. Save all deployed addresses, including Hats Protocol and Hats Module Factory, to your `.env` file
3. Make local development and testing much easier by removing the need to manually deploy these prerequisites
4. Provide clear instructions in the README about the automatic deployment behavior

This should solve the issue and make the deployment process more developer-friendly!
